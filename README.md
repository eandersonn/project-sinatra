# Sinatra Project 2021

## What is it about and Why you made it?

This sinatraProject is what the title says. A sinatra project that is used to create an account for a school on a localhost. This project was made for users to create assignments. They can edit and delete only their assignments. I came up with this project based on the requirements needed for the flatiron sinatra project. I wanted to create something that was quick and passed all the requirements due to lack of time. So I came up with the association between teachers and assignments.

## How to use it?

When wanting to use this project after following the installation steps. You would have to run shotgun in the terminal to open up a localhost. This project is for "teachers" to be able to create "assignments" for their "students". First you willl need to create an account or if you have used the localhost already you can login with your previous account. Then see all the assignments created for the school and even create your own. You can edit and delete only your assignments in this localhost. You can even logout.
